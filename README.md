# HorusChallenge

For this project, I used Xamarin Forms 4.8 with MvvmCross Framework A Core project, written as a .NET Standard library technology the and UI  containing the Views and platform specific code for interacting with the Core.
I Used different types of libraries such as Rg.PopUp, to create alert PopUps throughout the app using Messaging Center,
Xf.material to be able to create Letters.
Implement unit testing using xUnit with fluentAssertions, Moq.

It would be necessary to implement Covervelete in order to obtain the code coverage of the application.
