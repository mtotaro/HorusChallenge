# HorusChallenge

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The objective of this project is a small application created in Xamarin Forms 4.8 which has two screens with a login and a list of challenges. The idea was to be able to faithfully reproduce the challenge given by horus. This app was played on Android.
I've used MVVM Architecture, with MVVMCross framework. You can find more information about MVVMCross ([here](https://www.mvvmcross.com/documentation/)).
I used different types of libraries such as Rg.PopUp, to create alert PopUps throughout the app using Messaging Center,
Xf.material to be able to create Cards.
Implement unit testing using xUnit with fluentAssertions, Moq.

It would be necessary to implement Covervelete in order to obtain the code coverage of the application.	
<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

You can run the application with Android api level 21 onwards.
